This is a fullstack applcation for a dealership.  To start the application clone the repo with the command git clone. Then navigate to the repo folder and run the command docker-compose up. This will start a docker container with a postgres database instance on a server as well as create the database and relevant tables. There are four tables in the database -- one for Cars, Customers, Employees, and Sales. Once the database server is running start the flask server by running the command  python server.py. You may get errors regarding dependencies, be sure to pip install any dependencies that are indicated as not available or unrecognized with the command pip install library.
